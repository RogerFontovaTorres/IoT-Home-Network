This project attempts to create a whole network of IoT. This network is composed of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{MQTT broker:} It enables the communication between the temperature sensors and the cloud service.
  \item \textbf{Kafka broker:} It enables the communication between the cloud service and the AI agent.
  \item \textbf{Temperature sensors:} Simulated sensors that read temperatures from a CSV file and send them to the MQTT broker.
  \item \textbf{Cloud Service:} Reads the data sent by the sensors to the MQTT broker, stores the data, sends it to a Kafka broker, receives the AI predictions sent to the Kafka broker, and stores all the data.
  \item \textbf{AI agent:} Makes predictions with the given temperatures.
  \item \textbf{Non relational database:} Stores all the processed data by the cloud service.
\end{itemize}

In the following sections it will be explained the main decision that we have taken in order to implement the whole network. \\

However, we will not explain the MQTT publishers (the temperature sensors), and the ai-agent since it has been provided by the professor.
