# IoT-Home-Network

This project tries to simulate an IoT network composed by some sensors, a cloud service that processes the sensors data, an ai-agent that makes predictions and a non relational database.

The following image is an schema of the way it works the cloud-service and how do each thread communicate with the others:

## Execute the project

In order to execute the project the following dependencies are needed:
  - maven
  - jdk17
  - Docker (also docker compose)
  
First of all we will create the database, so we acces the database folder and execute

```
docker compose up
```

Now we can access the database client by searching "localhost:8086" on our favorite browswer
  - username: iot
  - password: iothomenetwork

We will create an access token and paste it inisde the variable token from the file DatabaseController.java (it can be found on cloud-service/src/main/java/iot/cloudservice/database/DatabaseController.java).

Then we will compile the java code:

```
mvn clean package
```

Once it finishes, we will to create the docker image:

```
docker build -t cloud-service .
```

Finally, we can run the whole project typing the following command on the root of the project:

```
docker compose up
```
